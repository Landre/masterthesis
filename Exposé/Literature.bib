abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The German health interview and examination survey for adults (DEGS1) with the mental health module (DEGS1-MH) is the successor to the last survey of mental disorders in the general German population 15 years ago (GHS-MHS). This paper reports the basic findings on the 12-month prevalence of mental disorders, associated disabilities and self-reported healthcare utilization. METHODS: A representative national cohort (age range 18-79 years, n = 5,317) was selected and individuals were personally examined (87.5 {\%} face to face and 12.5 {\%} via telephone) by a comprehensive clinical interview using the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI) questionnaire. RESULTS: The overall 12-month prevalence of mental disorders was 27.7 {\%} with substantial differences between subgroups (e.g. sex, age, socioeconomic status). Mental disorders were found to be particularly impairing (elevated number of disability days). Less than 50 {\%} of those affected reported to be in contact with health services due to mental health problems within the last 12 months (range 10-40 {\%} depending on the number of diagnoses). CONCLUSIONS: Mental disorders were found to be commonplace with a prevalence level comparable to that found in the 1998 predecessor study but several further adjustments will have to be made for a sound methodological comparison between the studies. Apart from individual distress, elevated self-reported disability indicated a high societal disease burden of mental disorders (also in comparison with many somatic diseases). Despite a relatively comprehensive and well developed mental healthcare system in Germany there are still optimisation needs for treatment rates.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of breath-hold, contrast material-enhanced, three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) angiography in the assessment of the aortoiliac inflow tract and renal arteries with conventional catheter angiography as the standard of reference. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 39 patients with symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, both catheter and contrast-enhanced, 3D MR angiography were performed. In a prospective blinded analysis, each vascular segment (23 segments per arterial tree) was evaluated for the presence of obstructive stenosis, graded as mild ({\textless}50{\%}), severe (50{\%}-99{\%}), or occlusion (100{\%}), as well as for aneurysmal disease. RESULTS: Obstructive (n = 2) and aneurysmatic aortic (n = 6) lesions and 10 of 11 accessory renal arteries were identified and graded correctly with MR angiography. For detection of hemodynamically significant stenotic lesions ({\textgreater}50{\%}) or occlusions with MR angiography, sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were 93{\%} and 98{\%} for the renal arteries, 96{\%} and 100{\%} for the common iliac arteries, 93{\%} and 93{\%} for the external iliac arteries, and 96{\%} and 94{\%} for the internal iliac arteries. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography is comparable with that of catheter angiography and thus may contribute to assessment of the aorta, the renal arteries, and the pelvic arterial system in patients with peripheral vascular disease before they undergo therapy.},

@article{Rough2017,
abstract = {Ubiquitous mobile technology affords clinicians new opportunities to enhance personalised, patient-centric care remotely, easing the burden on both patient and clinician. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) involves the repeated assessment of patients on their symptoms or behaviours, and their external contexts, as they go about their everyday lives, enhancing ecological validity and minimising recall bias. While previously conducted with paper diaries, ESM smartphone applications are now being employed, that have a range of benefits over paper-based methods including the ability to scale to many more patients. However, development of such applications is time-consuming and requires considerable programming knowledge. This has prompted the development of ESM creation tools that alleviate a researcher from the burden of programming an ESM application from scratch. This paper presents our work on Jeeves, a visual environment for creating secure ESM Android applications, and a usability evaluation we conducted with health psychology students.},
