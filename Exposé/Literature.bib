abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The German health interview and examination survey for adults (DEGS1) with the mental health module (DEGS1-MH) is the successor to the last survey of mental disorders in the general German population 15 years ago (GHS-MHS). This paper reports the basic findings on the 12-month prevalence of mental disorders, associated disabilities and self-reported healthcare utilization. METHODS: A representative national cohort (age range 18-79 years, n = 5,317) was selected and individuals were personally examined (87.5 {\%} face to face and 12.5 {\%} via telephone) by a comprehensive clinical interview using the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI) questionnaire. RESULTS: The overall 12-month prevalence of mental disorders was 27.7 {\%} with substantial differences between subgroups (e.g. sex, age, socioeconomic status). Mental disorders were found to be particularly impairing (elevated number of disability days). Less than 50 {\%} of those affected reported to be in contact with health services due to mental health problems within the last 12 months (range 10-40 {\%} depending on the number of diagnoses). CONCLUSIONS: Mental disorders were found to be commonplace with a prevalence level comparable to that found in the 1998 predecessor study but several further adjustments will have to be made for a sound methodological comparison between the studies. Apart from individual distress, elevated self-reported disability indicated a high societal disease burden of mental disorders (also in comparison with many somatic diseases). Despite a relatively comprehensive and well developed mental healthcare system in Germany there are still optimisation needs for treatment rates.},
