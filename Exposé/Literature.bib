abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The German health interview and examination survey for adults (DEGS1) with the mental health module (DEGS1-MH) is the successor to the last survey of mental disorders in the general German population 15 years ago (GHS-MHS). This paper reports the basic findings on the 12-month prevalence of mental disorders, associated disabilities and self-reported healthcare utilization. METHODS: A representative national cohort (age range 18-79 years, n = 5,317) was selected and individuals were personally examined (87.5 {\%} face to face and 12.5 {\%} via telephone) by a comprehensive clinical interview using the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI) questionnaire. RESULTS: The overall 12-month prevalence of mental disorders was 27.7 {\%} with substantial differences between subgroups (e.g. sex, age, socioeconomic status). Mental disorders were found to be particularly impairing (elevated number of disability days). Less than 50 {\%} of those affected reported to be in contact with health services due to mental health problems within the last 12 months (range 10-40 {\%} depending on the number of diagnoses). CONCLUSIONS: Mental disorders were found to be commonplace with a prevalence level comparable to that found in the 1998 predecessor study but several further adjustments will have to be made for a sound methodological comparison between the studies. Apart from individual distress, elevated self-reported disability indicated a high societal disease burden of mental disorders (also in comparison with many somatic diseases). Despite a relatively comprehensive and well developed mental healthcare system in Germany there are still optimisation needs for treatment rates.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of breath-hold, contrast material-enhanced, three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) angiography in the assessment of the aortoiliac inflow tract and renal arteries with conventional catheter angiography as the standard of reference. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 39 patients with symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, both catheter and contrast-enhanced, 3D MR angiography were performed. In a prospective blinded analysis, each vascular segment (23 segments per arterial tree) was evaluated for the presence of obstructive stenosis, graded as mild ({\textless}50{\%}), severe (50{\%}-99{\%}), or occlusion (100{\%}), as well as for aneurysmal disease. RESULTS: Obstructive (n = 2) and aneurysmatic aortic (n = 6) lesions and 10 of 11 accessory renal arteries were identified and graded correctly with MR angiography. For detection of hemodynamically significant stenotic lesions ({\textgreater}50{\%}) or occlusions with MR angiography, sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were 93{\%} and 98{\%} for the renal arteries, 96{\%} and 100{\%} for the common iliac arteries, 93{\%} and 93{\%} for the external iliac arteries, and 96{\%} and 94{\%} for the internal iliac arteries. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography is comparable with that of catheter angiography and thus may contribute to assessment of the aorta, the renal arteries, and the pelvic arterial system in patients with peripheral vascular disease before they undergo therapy.},

@article{Rough2017,
abstract = {Ubiquitous mobile technology affords clinicians new opportunities to enhance personalised, patient-centric care remotely, easing the burden on both patient and clinician. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) involves the repeated assessment of patients on their symptoms or behaviours, and their external contexts, as they go about their everyday lives, enhancing ecological validity and minimising recall bias. While previously conducted with paper diaries, ESM smartphone applications are now being employed, that have a range of benefits over paper-based methods including the ability to scale to many more patients. However, development of such applications is time-consuming and requires considerable programming knowledge. This has prompted the development of ESM creation tools that alleviate a researcher from the burden of programming an ESM application from scratch. This paper presents our work on Jeeves, a visual environment for creating secure ESM Android applications, and a usability evaluation we conducted with health psychology students.},

@article{Batalas2018,
abstract = {Ambulatory assessment (AA) is a research method that aims to collect longitudinal biopsychosocial data in groups of individuals. AA studies are commonly conducted via mobile devices such as smartphones. Researchers tend to communicate their AA protocols to the community in natural language by describing step-by-step procedures operating on a set of materials. However, natural language requires effort to transcribe onto and from the software systems used for data collection, and may be ambiguous, thereby making it harder to reproduce a study. Though AA protocols may also be written as code in a programming language, most programming languages are not easily read by most researchers. Thus, the quality of scientific discourse on AA stands to gain from protocol descriptions that are easy to read, yet remain formal and readily executable by computers. This paper makes the case for using the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to achieve this. While HTML can suitably describe AA materials, it cannot describe AA procedures. To resolve this, and taking away lessons from previous efforts with protocol implementations in a system called TEMPEST, we offer a set of custom HTML5 elements that help treat HTML documents as executable programs that can both render AA materials, and effect AA procedures on computational platforms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Web-based cognitive-behavioral therapeutic (CBT) apps have demonstrated efficacy but are characterized by poor adherence. Conversational agents may offer a convenient, engaging way of getting support at any time. OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. METHODS In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, "Depression in College Students," as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). RESULTS Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67{\%} female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93{\%}, 54/58), and Caucasian (79{\%}, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83{\%} (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17{\%} attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants' comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy. CONCLUSIONS Conversational agents appear to be a feasible, engaging, and effective way to deliver CBT.},
